## Set Up Conductor Java SDK

Add `orkes-conductor-client` dependency to your project.

### Gradle

For Gradle-based projects, modify the `build.gradle` file in the project directory by adding the following line to the dependencies block in that file:

```
implementation 'io.orkes.conductor:orkes-conductor-client:2.0.1'
```

### Maven

For Maven-based projects, modify the `pom.xml` file in the project directory by adding the following XML snippet within the `dependencies` section:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.orkes.conductor</groupId>
  <artifactId>orkes-conductor-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.14</version>
</dependency>
```

## Hello World Application Using Conductor

In this section, we will create a simple "Hello World" application that executes a "greetings" workflow managed by Conductor.

### Step 1: Create Workflow

#### Creating Workflows by Code

Create `workflow/WorkflowCreator.java` with the following:

```java
package io.orkes.samples.quickstart.workflow;

import com.netflix.conductor.sdk.workflow.def.ConductorWorkflow;
import com.netflix.conductor.sdk.workflow.def.tasks.SimpleTask;

import com.netflix.conductor.sdk.workflow.executor.WorkflowExecutor;

public class WorkflowCreator {
    private final WorkflowExecutor executor;
    public WorkflowCreator(WorkflowExecutor executor) {
        this.executor = executor;
    }
    public ConductorWorkflow<WorkflowInput> createSimpleWorkflow() {
        ConductorWorkflow<WorkflowInput> workflow = new ConductorWorkflow<>(executor);
        workflow.setName("hello");
        workflow.setVersion(1);
        SimpleTask greetingsWF = new SimpleTask("greetings", "greetings");
        greetingsWF.input("name", "${workflow.input.name}");
        workflow.add(greetingsWF);
        return workflow;
    }
}
```
Create `workflow/WorkflowInput.java` with the following:

```java
package io.orkes.samples.quickstart.workflow;

public class WorkflowInput {
    private String name;
    public WorkflowInput(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getName() {
            return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

#### (Alternatively) Creating Workflows in JSON

Create `workflow.json` with the following:

```json
{
  "name": "hello",
  "description": "hello workflow",
  "version": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "greet",
      "taskReferenceName": "greet_ref",
      "type": "SIMPLE",
      "inputParameters": {
        "name": "${workflow.input.name}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "timeoutPolicy": "TIME_OUT_WF",
  "timeoutSeconds": 60
}
```

Workflows must be registered to the Conductor server. Use the API to register the greetings workflow from the JSON file above:


```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
http://localhost:8080/api/metadata/workflow -d @workflow.json
```

[!note]
> [!note]
> To use the Conductor API, the Conductor server must be up and running (see [Running over Conductor standalone (installed locally)](#running-over-conductor-standalone-installed-locally))

### Step 2: Write Worker

Create `workers/ConductorWorkers.java` with a simple worker and workflow function.

> [!note]
> A single workflow can have task workers written in different languages and deployed anywhere, making your workflow polyglot and distributed!

```java
package io.orkes.samples.quickstart.workers;

import com.netflix.conductor.sdk.workflow.task.InputParam;
import com.netflix.conductor.sdk.workflow.task.WorkerTask;

public class ConductorWorkers {
    @WorkerTask("greetings")
    public void greeting(@InputParam("name") String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello my friend " + name);
    }
}
```

Now, we are ready to write our main application, which will execute our workflow.


### Step 3: Write *Hello World* Application

Let's add `helloworld.java` with a `main` method:

```java
package io.orkes.samples.quickstart;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException;

import com.netflix.conductor.common.run.Workflow;
import com.netflix.conductor.sdk.workflow.def.ConductorWorkflow;

import io.orkes.samples.quickstart.utils.SDKUtils;
import io.orkes.samples.quickstart.workflow.WorkflowCreator;
import io.orkes.samples.quickstart.workflow.WorkflowInput;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException, TimeoutException {
        SDKUtils utils = new SDKUtils();
        WorkflowCreator workflowCreator = new WorkflowCreator(utils.getWorkflowExecutor());
        System.out.print("Workflow Result: ");
        ConductorWorkflow<WorkflowInput> simpleWorkflow = workflowCreator.createSimpleWorkflow();
        simpleWorkflow.setVariables(new HashMap<>());

        WorkflowInput input = new WorkflowInput("Orkes");
        CompletableFuture<Workflow> workflowExecution = simpleWorkflow.executeDynamic(input);
        Workflow workflowRun = workflowExecution.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        String url = utils.getUIPath() + workflowRun.getWorkflowId();
        System.out.println("See the workflow execution here: " + url);

        // Shutdown any background threads
        utils.shutdown();
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```
### Step 4: Create SDKUtils
Create `utils/SDKUtils.java` with the following:

```java
package io.orkes.samples.quickstart.utils;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;

import com.netflix.conductor.client.worker.Worker;
import com.netflix.conductor.sdk.workflow.executor.WorkflowExecutor;

import io.orkes.conductor.client.*;
import io.orkes.conductor.client.automator.TaskRunnerConfigurer;


public class SDKUtils {
    private final WorkflowExecutor workflowExecutor;
    private final MetadataClient metadataClient;
    private final WorkflowClient workflowClient;
    private final TaskClient taskClient;
    private ApiClient apiClient;
    private TaskRunnerConfigurer taskRunner;

    public SDKUtils() {

        String CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL = System.getenv("CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL");
        String key = System.getenv("KEY");
        String secret = System.getenv("SECRET");
        String conductorServer = System.getenv("CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL");
        if (conductorServer == null) {
            conductorServer = CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL;
        }
        if (StringUtils.isNotBlank(key)) {
            apiClient = new ApiClient(conductorServer, key, secret);
        } else {
            apiClient = new ApiClient(conductorServer);
        }
        apiClient.setReadTimeout(30_000);

        if (StringUtils.isBlank(key) || StringUtils.isBlank(secret)) {
            System.out.println(
                    "\n\nMissing KEY and|or SECRET.  Attempting to connect to "
                            + conductorServer
                            + " without authentication\n\n");
            apiClient = new ApiClient(conductorServer);
        }

        OrkesClients orkesClients = new OrkesClients(apiClient);
        this.metadataClient = orkesClients.getMetadataClient();
        this.workflowClient = orkesClients.getWorkflowClient();
        this.taskClient = orkesClients.getTaskClient();
        this.workflowExecutor = new WorkflowExecutor(this.taskClient, this.workflowClient, this.metadataClient, 10);
        this.workflowExecutor.initWorkers("io.orkes.samples.quickstart.workers");
        initWorkers(Arrays.asList());
    }

    private void initWorkers(List<Worker> workers) {
        TaskRunnerConfigurer.Builder builder = new TaskRunnerConfigurer.Builder(taskClient, workers);
        taskRunner = builder.withThreadCount(1).withTaskPollTimeout(5).build();
        // Start Polling for tasks and execute them
        taskRunner.init();  
    }

    public WorkflowExecutor getWorkflowExecutor() {
        return workflowExecutor;
    }

    public WorkflowClient getWorkflowClient() {
        return workflowClient;
    }

    public String getUIPath() {
        return apiClient.getBasePath().replaceAll("api", "").replaceAll("8080", "5000")
                + "execution/";
    }

    // Clean up resources
    public void shutdown() {
        this.apiClient.shutdown();
        this.workflowClient.shutdown();
        this.taskRunner.shutdown();
    }
}
```

## Running Workflows on Conductor Standalone (Installed Locally)

### Conductor Server Settings

Everything related to server settings should be done within the `ApiClient` class by setting the required parameters when initializing an object, like this:

```java
ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient("CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL");
```

If you are using Spring Framework, you can initialize the above class as a bean that can be used across the project.

### Start Conductor Server

To start the Conductor server in a standalone mode from a Docker image, type the command below:

```
docker run --init -p 8080:8080 -p 5000:5000 conductoross/conductor-standalone:3.15.0
```

To ensure the server has started successfully, open Conductor UI on http://localhost:5000.

### Execute Hello World Application

To run the application, type the following command:

```java
To Do
```

Now, the workflow is executed, and its execution status can be viewed from Conductor UI (http://localhost:5000).

Navigate to the **Executions** tab to view the workflow execution.

Open the Workbench tab and try running the 'greetings' workflow. You will notice that the workflow execution fails. This is because the task_handler.stop_processes() [helloworld.java] function is called and stops all workers included in the app, and therefore, there is no worker up and running to execute the tasks.

Now, let's update the app `helloworld.java`

```java
To Do
```

By commenting the lines that execute the workflow and stop the task polling mechanism, we can re-run the app and run the workflow from the Conductor UI. The task is executed successfully.

## Running Workflows on Orkes Conductor

For running the workflow in Orkes Conductor, 

- Update the Conductor server URL to your cluster name.

```java
 export CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL="https://[your-cluster-name].orkesconductor.io/api"
```

- If you want to run the workflow on the Orkes Conductor Playground, set the Conductor Server variable as follows:

```java
export CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=https://play.orkes.io/api
```

- Orkes Conductor requires authentication. [Obtain the key and secret from the Conductor server](https://orkes.io/content/how-to-videos/access-key-and-secret) and set the following environment variables.

```
export KEY=your_key
export SECRET=your_secret
```
Run the application and view the execution status from Conductor's UI Console.

> [!NOTE]
> That's it - you just created and executed your first distributed Java app!

## Learn More about Conductor Java SDK

There are three main ways you can use Conductor when building durable, resilient, distributed applications.

1. Write service workers that implement business logic to accomplish a specific goal - such as initiating payment transfer, getting user information from the database, etc.
2. Create Conductor workflows that implement application state - A typical workflow implements the saga pattern.
3. Use Conductor SDK and APIs to manage workflows from your application.
