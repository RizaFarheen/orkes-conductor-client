# Conductor Java SDK

Conductor is the leading open-source orchestration platform allowing developers to build highly scalable distributed applications. You can find the documentation for Conductor here: [Conductor Docs](https://orkes.io/content).

This repository provides a Java client for the Orkes Conductor Server.

## Set Up Conductor Java SDK

Add `orkes-conductor-client` dependency to your project.

### Gradle

For Gradle-based projects, modify the `build.gradle` file in the project directory by adding the following line to the dependencies block in that file:

```
implementation 'io.orkes.conductor:orkes-conductor-client:2.0.1'
```

### Maven

For Maven-based projects, modify the `pom.xml` file in the project directory by adding the following XML snippet within the `dependencies` section:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.orkes.conductor</groupId>
  <artifactId>orkes-conductor-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.14</version>
</dependency>
```

### Conductor Server Settings

Everything related to server settings should be done within the `ApiClient` class by setting the required parameters when initializing an object, like this:

```java
ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient("CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL");
```

If you are using Spring Framework, we can initialize the above class as a bean that can be used across the project.


(Optionally) If you are using a Conductor server that requires authentication:

- [Obtain the key and secret from the Conductor server](https://orkes.io/content/docs/getting-started/concepts/access-control) 

Once you have a key and secret, you can configure the app from properties or environment variables, as shown below:

```java
    String key = System.getenv("KEY");
    String secret = System.getenv("SECRET");
    String conductorServer = System.getenv("CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL");
    ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient(conductorServer, key, secret);
```

## Start Conductor Server

```
docker run --init -p 8080:8080 -p 5000:5000 conductoross/conductor-standalone:3.15.0
```

After starting the server, navigate to http://localhost:5000 to ensure the server has started successfully.

## Simple Hello World Application using Conductor

In this section, we will create a simple "Hello World" application that uses Conductor.

### Step 1: Create a Workflow

#### Use Code to create workflows

Create `HelloWorld.java` with the following:

```java
To Do
```
#### (Alternatively) Use JSON to create workflows

Create workflow.json with the following:

```json
{
  "name": "hello",
  "description": "hello workflow",
  "version": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "greet",
      "taskReferenceName": "greet_ref",
      "type": "SIMPLE",
      "inputParameters": {
        "name": "${workflow.input.name}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "timeoutPolicy": "TIME_OUT_WF",
  "timeoutSeconds": 60
}
```

Now, register this workflow with the server:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
http://localhost:8080/api/metadata/workflow -d @workflow.json
```

### Step 2: Write Worker

Create `greetings.java` with a simple worker and workflow function.

> [!note]
> A single workflow application can have workers written in different languages.

```java
To Do
```

### Step 3: Write *your* application

```java
To Do
```

> [!NOTE]
> That's it - you just created your first distributed Java app!
> 

## Using Conductor in your application

There are three main ways you can use Conductor when building durable, resilient, distributed applications.

1. Write service workers that implement business logic to accomplish a specific goal - such as initiating payment transfer, getting user information from the database, etc.
2. Create Conductor workflows that implement application state - A typical workflow implements the saga pattern.
3. Use Conductor SDK and APIs to manage workflows from your application.
